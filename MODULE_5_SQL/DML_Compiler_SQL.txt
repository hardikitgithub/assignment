What is DML Compiler in SQL? 

DML is defined by Data Manipulation Language to manipulate data itself with the following 
commands:
SELECT : it helps to retrieve data from one or more tables in the database 
INSERT : it helps to insert data into a existing table 
UPDATE : it helps to update existing data within a existing table 
DELETE : it helps to delete all records from a table 
         It translates DML statements in a query language into low-level 
         instruction that the query evaluation engine can understand.
