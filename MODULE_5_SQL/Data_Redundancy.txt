What do you understand By Data Redundancy? 
 
In database management, data redundancy refers to the duplication of data in a database. This 
means that the same piece of data is stored in multiple places within the database. 
Data redundancy can have both advantages and disadvantages. 
The main advantage of data redundancy is that it can improve the reliability and availability of the 
data, since multiple copies of the data are stored. If one copy of the data is lost or becomes 
unavailable, the other copies can be used to access the data. 
However, data redundancy can also have some disadvantages. 
One of the main disadvantages is that it can lead to data inconsistencies, where different copies of 
the data are not the same. 
This can be a problem if the data is updated, as the different copies of the data will not be in sync 
with each other. This can make it difficult to know which copy of the data is correct. 
Overall, while data redundancy can be useful in some situations, it is important to carefully consider 
the trade-offs before implementing it.
