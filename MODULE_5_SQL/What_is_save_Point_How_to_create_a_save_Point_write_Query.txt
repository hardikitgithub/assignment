What is save Point? How to create a save Point write a Query? 


Save point is a command in SQL that is used with the rollback command. 
It is a command in Transaction Control Language that is used to mark the transaction in a table. 
Consider you are making a very long table, and you want to roll back only to a certain position in a 
table then; this can be achieved using the save point. 
If you made a transaction in a table, you could mark the transaction as a certain name, and later on, 
if you want to roll back to that point, you can do it easily by using the transaction's name. 
Save point is helpful when we want to roll back only a small part of a table and not the whole table. 
In simple words, we can say save point is a bookmark in SQL. 

start transaction; 

savepoint a; 
insert into student(sname,age,mobile,courseid) values("Viraj",48,"8789859654",3); 
insert into student(sname,age,mobile,courseid) values("virat",38,"6005460004",3);

savepoint b; 
insert into student(sname,age,mobile,courseid) values("yuvarj",45,"6546000489",3); 
insert into student(sname,age,mobile,courseid) values("",48,"4546454",3); 

rollback to b;
